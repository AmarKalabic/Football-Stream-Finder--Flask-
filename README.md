#Deprecated
Since this whole project relied on getting data from r/soccerstreams subreddit, and it was taken down, this whole project is now unusable. Feel free to use any parts of it in your projects (open source and commercial too), if you find them usable.

~~# Football-Stream-Finder--Flask-
Small Flask app that fetches stream links for football/soccer games from reddit. It's really simple and design is minimalistic.
Edit and use as you wish, but please add source.~~
